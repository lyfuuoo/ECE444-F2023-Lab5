## Pros and cons of Test Driven Development(TDD)
TDD is an evolutionary approach to development that combines a test-first story, where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

Pros: 
* TDD promotes robust software design by encouraging developers to write tests before code. This results in thoughtful consideration of functionality and design, leading to well-architected and modular code. Additionally, TDD increases code coverage, rigorously testing a larger portion of the codebase and minimizing the risk of bugs and other issues. The result is more reliable software.

* In addition to catching errors early in the development process, Test-Driven Development (TDD) also helps to improve the efficiency of the development process. The tests themselves serve as comprehensive documentation, providing a clear outline of the expected behavior of the code. This documentation aspect not only saves time that would be spent on manual testing but also fosters consistency and reliability in the testing process. Developers can quickly understand the intended functionality, which enables them to make changes confidently and efficiently. This streamlined testing procedure leads to faster development cycles and higher productivity.

Cons:
* One of the potential downsides is that developers might become overly reliant on testing at the expense of other critical aspects of software development. In some cases, they could be so focused on passing tests that they overlook crucial design considerations or architectural decisions. Moreover, the single-minded pursuit of passing tests could potentially stifle creativity and innovation in problem-solving.

* Maintaining a balance between test coverage and the actual project requirements poses another challenge. Writing tests for every possible scenario may seem thorough, but it can lead to a bloated and convoluted test suite. This excessiveness not only complicates the maintenance of tests but also makes it difficult for developers to understand the purpose and significance of each test case. Consequently, the meaning behind specific tests might be lost, making it challenging for developers to troubleshoot or improve the codebase effectively.

* Test-Driven Development (TDD) can create a deceptive feeling of safety. Although testing is crucial, relying solely on tests can foster a belief that the absence of failed tests results in perfect software. In reality, tests can only cover predetermined scenarios, which can leave potential gaps in unanticipated edge cases or interactions between different components. Consequently, a false sense of confidence can emerge, leading to insufficient attention to thorough manual testing and real-world usage scenarios.
